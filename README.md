# Introduction to Troosh
![Troosh](https://troosh.app/logo.png "Logo")

**[Troosh](https://troosh.app)** is a platform which introduces a new experience for online learning. Everyone learns at their own pace and can even choose to learn on teams. Projects is a feature we focus heavily, they are like small internships but for casual learning.

Another cool thing is that at **[Troosh](https://troosh.app)** we don't care about your geographical location or socioeconomic status. As long as you can create a healthy and helpful learning environment you can come on board!
